## Track Running And Cycling

### Introduction
Tracy is an open source fitness tracking application with the main focus on simplicity.
It has only the basic features like visualization on map and basic analytics.
The backend is written in Laravel framework, the frontend uses vue.js, and the analytics
is created with open street maps, leafletjs, and Highcharts.

The main goal of this application is to learn the Laravel framework.

### Key features
1. Import workout from GPX file
2. Import workouts from [Endomondo](http://endomondo.com)
3. Visualize workouts on the map
4. Analyze workouts: speed, heart rate, and altitude

### Installation
1. Clone the source code
2. Install the dependencies using composer `composer install`
3. Make a copy of the `.env.example` file and rename it to `.env`
4. Create a database and set up database parameters in `.env`

```
DB_CONNECTION=mysql
DB_HOST=127.0.0.1
DB_PORT=3306
DB_DATABASE=homestead
DB_USERNAME=homestead
DB_PASSWORD=secret
```

5. (optional) Set up the parameters in `.env` for seeding the database with an initial
user

```
SEED_USER_EMAIL="john@email.com"
SEED_USER_NAME="John Doe"

```

6. (optional) Set up you endomondo.com login parameters

For any additional information on laravel installation please see
https://laravel.com/docs/5.6/installation

### Usage
#### Import workouts from [endomondo.com](http://endomondo.com)
Tracy uses an unofficial api (https://github.com/fabulator/endomondo-api)
to import the workouts from endomondo. The login details for endomondo
are stored in the `.env` file which is not ideal, but endomondo does not
provide any public api. Import all workouts using the following command:
```
    php artisan import:endomondo
```

By default the import command only creates the new workouts, and skips the
 existing (already imported) ones. If you want to delete all existing workouts
 use the `--clear` option. Please note that the --clear deletes all workouts
 associated with your user. The email address of the Tracy user should be the same
 as the endomondo login email.

 #### Import from GPX file
 Use the Workouts/import menu to import a workout from a GPX file.

 #### Import from TCX file
